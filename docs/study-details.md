# Study Details

## Participation Criteria
Participants were allowed to participate in this study if they:
* were 18 years of age or older, and,
* had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (they could wear contact lenses, but 
eyeglasses would not fit with the eye tracking headset), sufficient to read the pips on
a die at arms length without squinting or straining.

Participation was disallowed if they:
* had neurological impairments that affected their ability to count, follow verbal 
instructions, or move their head or arms,
* had muscular impairments of the eyes, neck, trunk (torso), arm, or hand that would 
make it difficult or painful to move those body parts, or,
* could not hear auditory instructions.

## Methodology
Human participants were recruited to gather eye tracking and pupillometry data. 
The study was approved by the Dalhousie University Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Ethics Board (Study \#2024-7211).

The target population was healthy people aged 18 years or older with normal or corrected 
to normal vision and hearing. Healthy adults were chosen as a target population to 
determine if a reliable, measurable pupillometric differences exist before involving a 
more vulnerable population like stroke survivors. Normal or corrected-to-normal vision
is required because vision impairments could result in different gaze behaviours among 
the participants. Participants were considered to have normal vision if they could 
comfortably read the number off of a die at arms-length without squinting or straining. 
The eye-tracking hardware used in this study, the PupilLabs Pupil Core headset, does not
fit over glasses but other corrections such as contact lenses were permitted.

Participants were excluded if they had muscular or neurological impairments, or an 
inability to follow auditory instructions. Muscular impairments of the eye, head, or
neck could lead to compensatory movement that affects the way that a participant gazes 
at their environment. Neurological impairments could have a similar effect and could 
also change the responsiveness of the pupil.

Participants were recruited through word of mouth, physical posters, and advertisements
shared via departmental email lists at Dalhousie University. A \$15 honorarium was 
offered as an incentive to all participants.

Participants were asked to perform a series of tasks with and without motor action while
their gaze and pupil dilation were recorded by an eye-tracking headset. All participants
were briefed on the purpose and process of the experiment beforehand and their consent
was recorded.

Experiments were conducted in a windowless room with ceiling-mounted lights. 
Participants were seated at a table covered by a black tablecloth with four dice placed
on a raised platform. The dice were placed in a square approximately 14 cm on a side.
The dice were numbered one to four, left to right, top to bottom. Multiple dice were
used to encourage different eye movements within the participant's field of view.

Participants donned a PupilLabs Pupil Core headset. The headset was calibrated with the 
calibration marker placed in the center of the square of dice. Calibration was 
considered successful if the resulting model accuracy, the difference between the 
predicted gaze position of their eye and the actual position, was less than or equal to 
2.5 degrees and the calibrated field of view encompassed all four dice and the cross on 
the background.

Participants were asked to perform one of two tasks selected at random: pick up one of 
the dice or read the number value on one of the dice without touching it. These two 
tasks represented the desired classes to differentiate: looking at an object with motor
intent and action (an **Action** task) versus looking at an object without motor intent
or action (an **Observation** task). Each trial began with the participant looking at 
the cross on the background. The experimenter triggered the start of each trial when the
participant's gaze stayed on the cross for a few seconds. One second of data was 
recorded as a baseline, then an audio instruction would begin to play from the speakers.
The audio instruction was either "Pick up" (**Action**) or "Read off"
(**Observation**), followed by a number corresponding to the die with which to interact.
The number of the die was randomized for each trial. In an **Action** task, the 
participant would reach with their dominant hand to pick up the commanded die, lift it 
from the platform and place it on the table, then return it to its original position.
The recording would end once the participant placed the die on the table. In an 
**Observation** task, the participant would look at the commanded die without moving 
their hand and report the number to the experimenter. The recording would end once the
participant reported the die number. After reporting the number, the participant would 
wait approximately two seconds, pick up the die, roll it on the table to get a new 
number, and then return it to its place on the platform. The dice were rolled to ensure
that the participant would not be able to memorize the number on each die over the
course of the experiment. Participants were asked to avoid reading or memorizing the
dice numbers between trials. If the participant made a mistake, such as interacting with
the wrong die or getting distracted, the trial would be repeated.

Tasks were assigned at random until the participant had done each task 60 times, for a
total of 120 trials. The headset was re-calibrated every 30 trials to ensure that it had
not slipped and was still reporting accurate eye measurements. The total experiment
duration was approximately one hour.
