## Introduction
The purpose of this study is to learn about the differences between eye movements and 
changes in pupil size when picking up objects versus observing objects. We collected
gaze tracking and pupillometric data to train an algorithm to distinguish a person’s 
intended action (pick up or observe an object) based solely on their eye behaviour. This 
algorithm will serve as a proof-of-concept for an intuitive controller of assisted 
devices for people with arm motor impairments.

Participants in the study were asked to perform a series of simple tasks while their 
eyes and the scene in front of them, including their hands, were video-recorded. The 
recordings were captured using a Pupil Core headset (https://pupil-labs.com/products/core).
The tasks involved picking up dice from a table and reading numbers off those dice.

## Participation Criteria
Participants were allowed to participate in this study if they:
* were 18 years of age or older, and,
* had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (they could wear contact lenses, but 
eyeglasses would not fit with the eye tracking headset), sufficient to read the pips on
a die at arms length without squinting or straining.

Participation was disallowed if they:
* had neurological impairments that affected their ability to count, follow verbal 
instructions, or move their head or arms,
* had muscular impairments of the eyes, neck, trunk (torso), arm, or hand that would 
make it difficult or painful to move those body parts, or,
* could not hear auditory instructions.
